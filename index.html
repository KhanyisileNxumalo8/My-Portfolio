<h1 id="abt">About me</h1>

<p>I am a second year BSc General student at the University of the Witwatersrand majoring in Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. My academic journey is driven by a strong curiosity about how the natural world works, from the fundamental laws that govern physical systems to the mathematical principles that describe them and the chemical processes that shape matter at a molecular level. Studying these three disciplines together has strengthened my analytical thinking, problem solving skills, and ability to approach complex challenges from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>I am a proud ProMaths Alumni, an experience that played a significant role in shaping my academic growth and confidence in STEM. Through ProMaths, I developed a solid foundation in mathematics and science, as well as valuable skills such as discipline, resilience, collaboration, and time management. Being part of this community exposed me to academic excellence, mentorship, and the importance of giving back by supporting learning and growth in others.</p>
<p>Currently, I am also part of the ProMaths Co-co Code Bootcamp, where I am expanding my skills beyond traditional science by learning web development and programming. Through this bootcamp, I have been gaining hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building projects such as portfolio websites, interactive web pages, and simple applications. This experience has helped me develop logical thinking, creativity, and a practical understanding of how technology can be used to communicate ideas and solve problems</p>
<p>Overall, I consider myself a hardworking, curious, and growth-oriented individual who is passionate about learning, self-development, and making meaningful contributions in academic and professional spaces.</p>
